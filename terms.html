              <ol>
                <li>These policies provides legal advice and covers the fees charged by an attorney in the representation of civil, criminal and labour related matters up to the amount listed on the policy schedule.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>The policies have a three month waiting period. Only matters arising after the waiting period will be considered for cover.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>Telephonic advice is available after payment of your first premium, even on excluded matters or matters arising in the waiting period.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>Fees charged by a lawyer are covered on claims that are accepted by Shield Legal, for a lawyer on Shield’s panel, appointed by Shield Legal, for as long as the claim lies within the terms and conditions of the policy.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>We offer plans that cover for yourself only, or family plans that can include cover for your spouse, and up to three children under the age of 18.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>We will cover your children up to the age of 18, but if they are full time students, attending a registered tertiary institution they may remain on your policy up to the age of 21.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>Extended members can be covered, but may require an additional premium.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>Certain plans provide a lump sum in the event of accidental death cover too.<br /><br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>Accidental death cover is provided from receipt of the first premium and continues as long as the monthly premium is paid, when due.<br /><br /></li>
                    <li>Cover is reduced by 50% when you turn 76 and ceases when you turn 80 years old.<br /><br /></li>

                <li>The Bail Benefit is automatically included on your policy at no additional cost. We will pay up to R6, 000 on your behalf for bail if arrested for a minor crime.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>Cover is dependent on the continuous payment of your monthly premiums, when they are due. If a premium is missed, your waiting period will restart.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>Should you be retrenched, the Retrenchment Benefit will allow you to miss up three consecutive premiums without the waiting period or cover being effected (subject to the policy’s terms and conditions)<br /><br /></li>
                <li>There are certain types of legal matters that are not covered, like business matters and preexisting matters (any matter that arose before taking out the policy). The policy wording contains the full list of exclusions applicable to this policy. Please ensure your read these to familiarise yourself with all benefits, exclusions or waiting periods.<br /><br /></li>
